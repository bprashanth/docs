when plunder becomes a way of life for a group of men living 
together in society, they create for themselves in the course 
of time a legal system that authorizes it and a moral code 
that glorifies it.

As a civilizatoin we've had a good run. We had the industrial 
revolution, we survived that. We've built a lot of military tech,
we've survived that, so far. We built a banking system, we're
still struggling with that one.. but overall, a great run. 

When inflation happens it's attributed to:
1. Convince the people it's their fault - their wage claims are 
   too high
2. Lots of other people are speculating on housing prices

It's never attributed to: we've created money out of nothing,
lent it an interest and don't know how to pump it out of the 
system - that's why prices are going up.

### How are banks creating money

* Who benefits from the move to fiat (cui bono?): 
  - creators of money: banks, governments
  - people who get the money as soon as it's created 
     a. they can spend it before prices rise because of more 
        money in the system - buy assets cheap
     b. holders of these assets (that were purchased before 
        prices rise, or were held onto previously) benefit
     c. now we get speculative bubbles
     d. by the time money reaches the bottom of the pyramid
        things are expensive. 
     e. people at the bottom need to go back to banks for loans.
* For every dollar of GDP the US creates 5 dollars of debt.
  authoritarianism etc

### Post coldwar

Before 1989 we had a battle of communism vs market economy. 
Communism failed first because of a lack of human rights, 
social authoritarianism etc and we got:  
* Deregulation: get rid of rules for governing institutions
* Neo-Classical economics as the market framework (aka cap)
 
#### NC vs C

There are 2 main competing economic approaches which determine
how humans distribute wealth.
* Classical: 
  - more personal autonomy, less govt intervention
* NC: 
  - government should run the economy to solve social problems 
  - distribution of wealth managed by market
  - Ideology is the framework of capitalis
  - favors corporations 
  - legitimizes financialization of global economy
* Regan/Thatcher revolution led to a transfer of property and 
  wealth
* Wages/bonuses went up a lot in the financial part of the 
  economy

### Is this really capitalism?

* Government is supposed to be small
* Government not supposed to bail out banks 
* Floored enterprises face failure
* Individuals operate in a free market

Socialism for the rich, capitalism for the poor. Bailing 
bankrupt  banks out is socialism. There's no choice but for 
governments to fork over money because people have money in 
their accounts. Government needs to borrow. Revolution. 

### Lending and interest

* Newly created money from slashed interest rates entered the 
  housing market. 
  - Push dubious loans on people 
* Ordinary people in the west can't get ahead by wages so they 
  need to sink. It into a speculative use, like houses. 
* Racial lending, minorities were exploited and charged more 
  ("risk")
  - predatory lending practices
  - Wells Fargo foreclosures and sub-prime lending practices
* Laws passed by congress, 5 people from financial 
  industry / congressman paid to explain "good" policy.

### Policy and the FED 

Financial sector is powerful because of political and ideological
power. Ideological meaning brainwashing people into thinking 
finance is good, more is better, and unreglated finance is best.
This is the Washington/WallSt. corridor. 

Who controls congress? it's not a reflection of good democracy
when a group of people/companies can counter public interest 
through campaign contributions and lobbying. This is an advanced
Oligarchy in that the politicians are convinced that they really
need the 6 largest bank lightly regulated. If you try to change
this all types of bad things will happen.

The FED is essentially the lobbyist of the commercial banking
system. When the fed is in charge of policy it means WallSt has
veto power to the head of the FED. This means we're picking the 
regulators from the banking industry itself. Calling this 
regulation is just another form of Orwellian double thinking, 
it's really deregulation.

### GoldmanSachs

GoldmanSachs machine - using profits to buy effluence in 
Washington to influence policy, to make WallSt money easier,
to buy effluence in Washington (self reinforcing malfeasence 
machine). Goldman changed its banking status from investment 
-> comercial in 08, a month before the stock market crashed 
(eligible for govt protection). 

GS stareted selling securities put together from mortgages 
that they knew were worthless to unwitting consumers. They
placed bets (credit defaults) with AIG insuring themselves
against the failures of the securities they're peddling. 
Essentially they shorted their own clients by betting against
their clients, making billions.

Now they're back bigger than before and it has literally 
nothing to do with the economy. Extortionate bonuses, 
inequality and egregious rip-off mechanisms were defended as 
a way to achieving greater prosperity for all. Where does 
morality enter economic calculus? Smith gave us a free pass as 
a way to not think about morality with his invisible hand (
individuals in pursuit of their self interest are led as if by
an invisible hand to the best interst of society); his latter
day descendants have forgotten the caveats. 

### Trickledown economics (horse and sparrow theory)

Extreme wealth concentrated in a small minority will turn 
into horse shit. We need to restructure our political processes
to give more voice to the ordinary citizen and less voice to 
the monied interest groups. The democrats and the republics are 
beholden to corporate interests, and until they become 
unbeholden to the corporate interests we will never have a well
governed republic.
