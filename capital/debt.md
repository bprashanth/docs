# National debt

Government taking loans from the public, cooperations, banks etc.

## Printing money 

We have a ton of bad examples of printing money: 
* 1914 - American and Britan leave the gold standard
  - There wasn't enough gold to pay for these world wars
  - The people paid for them because the currency was devalued (prices shot up because government printed money)
* German Reparations as the outcome of the treaty of Versailles
* Weimar inflation as a result of Germany printing money after turning to a facist government
* Now we have fiat, central banks can print unlimited amounts of money. 

## Deficit and debt

Debt is measured as a % of GDP

```console
Deficit = tax - expenditure 
Debt = Accumulation of deficit
```

Whats driving deficits in coming decades? In the US it's healthcare for the old, social security

## Importance of savings

Everyone borrows, including the government, including cooperations. 
* Problem 1: Government borrows more than available for businesses
* Problem 2: lenders increase government interest rates 

Problem 2 is default and causes recession (Russia 1998, Argentina 2001, Greece 2008). 
Good news for countries like the US: loan interest is really low because other countries trust the US government.


## US debt

* 1 trillion dollar deficit
* Almost every year runs deficit since WW2
* US had a very strong economy at the end of Clinton (budget surplus)
* 2001 Afganisthan, Bush cut taxes!
  - Regan raised taxes to pay for the cold war
  - 2003 with Iraq also resulted in reduced tax
* The money came from debt - 6-10 trillion
  - Situation deteriorated with the recession of 08
* US government was unprepared, debt increases to 15 trillion

## UKs national debt

A billion here a billion there pretty soon you're taking money seriously
- used to be a joke
- 2016 debt is 1.6 trillion
* National debt clock
* Debt is not really repaid, it's rescued because of economic growth and inflation
* Other forms of debt:
  private - mortgages, consumer credit, coorporations etc

## Solutions

* Tax reforms for more equitable income distribution
* Which Americans qualify for medicare - programs need to remain solvent but reduce expenditure
* Reducing government spending is hard because it could result in loss of life etc

## Defaulting

* Repudiation or inflation
* Repudiation can take many forms: just miss a single payment, haircut on principle etc
* France defaulted in the 16th century, around the same time Britan didn't
