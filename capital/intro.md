# Introduction to inequality

Large inequality before and after the second world war.
The second spike was because of a separation of top managers who set their own renumeration.
Purchasing power of labourers remained low.

## Origins of the political economy

Early France/Britan, carried over to Kuznet's in the USA.

### Maluthus and young

* Essays on the principles of population
* Problem: Demographic concerns, rural exodus
  - land is the most important resource
* Solution: halt welfare, scrutinize poor

### Ricardo

* Principles of political economy and taxation
* Problem: Scarcity principle
  - capital replaces land
  - population will increase, everyone wants land, landlords will claim large incomes
  - Law of supply/demand will not fix the economy fast enough
  - soon landlords will own all land
* Solution: increase tax on land rents 

### Marx 

* Communist manifesto, das kapital
* Problem: infinite accumulation
  - wages will stagnaged
  - capital's share of national income will increase indefinitely
  - revolution, labour replaces capital
  - first signs of socialism
* Ignores technological progress and productivity (counterweight to capital accumulation)

### Kuznets 

* Shares of upper income groups in income and savings
* First rigorous statistical analysis using IT records 
* Inequality follows a bellcurve
  - Only looked this way because of pre-war taxation of the rich
* Rising tied lifts all boats

### Revolution

* British: parliment, premogeniture on land estates, political privileges for hereditary nobility, royal dynasty
* French: legal equality in the market, no aristocracy
* American: republican principle, slavery

## Insights on inequality

* Distribution of wealth cannot be reduced to purely economic mechanisms
* Twin forces of convergence x divergence 
  - Convergence can be natural (equal access to education, diffusion of knowledge, re-skilling) 
  - Divergence can be imposed (easier in slow economies, past wealth takes on disproportionate importance)
* private wealth (real estate, financial assets, professional capital, net of debt) 6,7 x NI
  - redistribution ~1950 led to elephant curve
  - savings rate increases with wealth
* inherited wealth takes a huge slice of NI in slow growing economies
  - inherited wealth plays a smaller role in fast populations (US vs France)
* r (avg annual rate of return on capital) > g (rate of growth of economy)
  - worse for more prefect capital markets 
* Multiple stages of globalization: 
  - 1st: WWI, light bulb, automobile, tv/radio
  - 2nd: WWII to date, computers, offshoring etc

## Appendix

### Economic growth

* Productivity: input : output ratio of labourer
* GDP: total value of all final goods 
* GNP: GDP + income earned by residents of a country from rest of world
* Growth: increase in capacity to produce, reflects as GDP/NDP/GNP etc
  - manifests as productivity increase

### Causes and outcome of the French revolution

It resulted in equality before the law and careers open to talent not as a birthright. i
Also resulted in a decline in the religious authority of the church.
It was caused by:
* economic hardships: agrarian crisis, demographic effects
* political: nobility vs monarchs over tax laws, bourgeoisie vs aristocracy
