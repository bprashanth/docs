# Growth and inequality

Growth analyzed as population and per capita growth. 
* population growth: this can be problematic if it outpaces productivity. 
* per capita growth: 
* economic growth: Both the above constitute economic growth, which is 
  more typically defined in terms of GDP. 
  - Economic growth must account for inflation
  - Infaltion results in a reliving of the Ricardo principle, i.e people 
    who held capital previous end up amassing wealth. 

## Demographic growth

* Only per capita growth results in better quality of life, but population 
growth usually preceeds it. 
* Law of cumulative growth:
  - Low annual growth rate over a long period gives rise to progress
  - 1% for both population and per capita over time 
* A per capital growth rate of 1-1.5% cannot be sustained without a 
  vertiginous increase in population.
* During earlier phases the effects of growth were wiped out by war and 
  famine.

### Stages of growth

* If demographic growth rate increases sharply (0.2-0.8) it will result
  in an increase in per capita growth and hence a stabilization in the 
  demography as lifespans increase and birth rates decreases until 
  eventually a demographic transition occurs. 
* UN forcasts that globally we're approaching a demographic transition.
  Most growth is forecasted for the first half of the 20th century,
  mostly due to Africa. A dip in demographic growth rate with a 
  *negative* rate in Asia, US etc is the central scenario of the UN.
* Demographic downturns can also be because of pronatal policies or 
  religious adoption (de-christianization in France).
* We can say the transition is complete if generation size is ~1/3 
  smaller, consistently. 
* If population growth rate is low, the job economy is inherited and 
  capital plays a much larger role. On the other hand if the next 
  generation earns much more than their parents (without inheritance)
  they will likely transition between classes. Growth increases social
  mobility and reduces the effects of capital, usually.

## Growth as PPP

PPP can be computed for a given region against itself: What does 
average income today buy in different periods of history? 

* This introduces a multi-dimensional concept of equality, since
  growth is different along different axis. 
* We can compare the average of all prices (price index) to any 
  given industry to understand a specific slice of the economy, eg: 
  how many carrots can an average worker afford today vs then?
  - industrial: prices fallen relative to avg, productivity is up.
  - food and agriculture: prices equal
    a. meat maintained the index but got better in quality
  - service growth: prices higher. 
    a. barbers charge more now because of inflation, but it takes 
       the same time.
* Inflation computed using CPI

## Inferences

Both the food and industrial sector started employing fewer number
of people because of productivity increases. The service sectory 
started absorbing more. Public services continues to absorb the same
amount (health, education etc). However, health and education contribute
the most to standard of living. 
* Privitizatoin of public services resulted in a sharp rise in GDP
  - National accounting doesn't count public capital like building
  - When privatized buildings, hospitals, equipment counts to GDP. 
* Society reproduces itself easily at 0.1-0.2%.
* Accelearted growth of ~5% only happens in countries that're playing 
  catch-up. 
* No historical example of a country in the global frontier with a growth
  rate of > 1.5% over an extended period of time. 
* High growth rates cannot be achieved without productivity boosts, which
  probably require new sources of energy.
* Growth can eradicate and create inequality
* Urgency to improve growth in England. Liberalization of economy viewed as
  the cause of slowdown. 
* Thatcher basically rolled back the welfare state. 
* Global demographic growth rates will decline to ~0 in second half of 20th.
* Emerging economies wil converge with developed economies till per capita
  growth rate also slows down. 


## Appendix

* Growth vs population:
  - Growing economies need and produce growing populations. 
  - malthusian trap: amount of food the land is capable of won't be enough 
    to support labour.
  - improving public services also improves labour quality: education, health, 
    immunization 
* Liberalization of economy
  - Neoliberalization phases: Thatcher x regan, clinton x blair. 
  - Broke down global trade barriers. Reduced role of government. Increases
    role of firms. Hayek? 
* CPI vs PPP: CPI is over time, PPP is over countries
