# Capital and Income and Output

Capital, National income and the effects of financial globalization.

## Capital

* Capital itself can consist of "real" property (estate) and financial/professional capital (plants, infra, machines, patents).
* Such capital can be owned by individuals (private), firms, foundations (ngos/church) or governments (public). 
  - public capital is usually low or negative (public debt)
  - IP is called immaterial capital
  - IP can be owned through financial assets like shares too
* The boundry between what *can* be owned has evolved over time (eg: national monuments, sea)
* Capital is both a store of value and a factor of production.

## Profit -> capital + wages

* Income is a flow, it's constant
* Capital is a stock that generates a flow
  - the flow is proportional to the accumulation of capital in all previous years combined
* All production must be distributed somehow
  - payment to laborers: wages, salaries, bonuses
  - payments to owners of capital: profits, dividends, royalties

### Inflection points

* shocks that buffered the economy before 1947: ww1, great depression, ww2, tax reforms
  - resulted in a dubiously low amount of capital in NI, because wealthy people were made to pay for the war
* events that brough the share of capital back up: 
  - ronald regan x margret thatcher brought a more conservative politcal regime
  - collapse of the soviet bloc and communism
  - financial globalization and deregulation

## National income

Defined as the sum of all incomes
```console
    NI = (GDP - depreciation, aka domestic output/NDP/domestic product) - net income from abroad
    NI = capital income + labour income
```

* DP typically 10% lower than GDP
* Net income from abroad = inflow - outflow
  - foreign dividends, profits, interestes, rent etc
  - if inflow is too high it leads to political instability
  - typically 1/2% of DP (i.e meaning ownership inside and outside is roughly equal)

### Historic evolution of NI

* WWI times wealth was more important. Economists were trying to compare France and England.
* WWII resulted in statisticians supplanting economists, publishing of annual data
  - still focused on national wealth
* Great Depression: governments realized they have no growth/output estimates
  - national wealth took a backseat
  - private capital evaporated (real estate and financial assets plumetted)
  - National accounts were setup

## First 2 laws of capitalism

* Limitation of national account: they are aggregates and averages, not inequalities and distributions
* 3 important metrics: 
  - B: Capital/Income ratio, only tells us the importance of capital in a society, i.e how intensely capitalistic a community is
  - r: rate of return on capital, aka yield on capital
  - A: fraction of NI made up of capital returns 

First law:
```console
    A = r x B
```

* Rate of return on some kinds of capital stays roughly constant 
  - rent rises till it's r=4%
  - this is the value of return enjoyed by someone investing a similar amount in, say, stocks
* first law is also applicable to accounts of a company
  - A, r and B vary between companies
  - certain sectors are capital intensive (eg: energy)

Second law:
```console
B proportional to savings rate
  inversely p to growth rate
```
Meaning slow growing economies turn capitalistic fast. 

## Current trends

* Regional blocs are more representative of equality
  - EU / Russia
  - USA/ Latin america
  - Sub-sahara/ north africa
  - China, India, Japan, other
* Range of global inequality today: Sub-sahara -> NA, 200 euros per capita -> 3000 euros percapita
* purchasing power partiy is more representative than exchange rate
  - ppp more stable 
  - ppp more representative since citiezens of EU don't spend in America
  - ppp of energy is different from textiles, shows that inequality is multidimensional
* Rich/poor countries are actually converging in inequality

## Foreign investment

* Global output is more equal than global income
  - foreign investments mean output is constant but income is much lower on one side
  - foreign countries invest because the marginal productivity of capital has falled at home
* Africa might be the only country that is largely owned by someone else (no foreign investment)
* FI is not a converging factor, convergence of output per head doesn't imply convergence of input per head
* FI results in 2 things:
  1. a bad sort of specialization - without much direction/specialization
  2. political instability
* Political instability happens because governments dispossess land, forming other factions that enforce property rights

## Conclusion

* Convergence driven by knowledge diffusion and productivity increase, not by becoming property of wealthy nations
* This is an outcome of an open market - free capital flows between countries rarely helps
* Better if a country uses savings to finance investment, instead of outside investment
* Open trade facilitates
  - financial mobilization (convert savings to investments)
  - education reskilling to keep up with global workforce
  - legal framework that entrepraneurs can count on to establish business 
* All these are an output of efficient government, which is the opposite of what FI encourages

## Appendix

* financial globalization: cross border capital flows; ended up giving countries roughly equal shares of ownership in each other.
  - economic globalization: free movement of goods, services, capital etc. We want everything except capital. 
* deregulation: repeal of government regulation of the economy
* neo-liberalism: resugrance of ASmith principles like free trade, no govt intervention, privatization etc
