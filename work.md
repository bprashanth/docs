# Work

There is a point of view, mostly in capitalism systems, that work is a burden. If you
weren't driven to work you'd vegitate. This is not true. People who love what they're 
doing and can control it want to keep doing it. One of the reasons Adam Smith was so
critical about division of labor, I mean he has an ode to division of labor at the 
beginning of the wealth of nations but he criticizes it at the end by saying: 
```
If we let division of labor to continue we will reduce people to creatures as stupid
and as ignorant as it's possible for a creature to be. 
```
.. because they'll simply be carrying out mechanical operations. What you are, your
intelligence, your understanding all the human characteristics come from your capacity
to carry out independent activities in association with, but not under the control of 
external authority. At the core of human nature is the need to be involved in free
and creative activity. The market systems that developed in the 19th century would've 
appalled Smith. 

The problem is very few people have the time or commitment or energy to break out of 
a system that supports the capitalistic notion of work. Modern industrial civilization
has developed within a system of convenient myths which are accepted as legitimate, 
even praise worthy, on the grounds that private vices yield public benefit - in the 
classic formulation; i.e the driving force of the culture we have today has been 
individual material gain and we are led to believe that this is something we should
all aspire to. There has been a massive effort to try to convince people that they want 
the superficial things in life, it's called advertising. 

As long as some specialized class is in a position of authority, it is going to set
policy in a way that benefits it. The question is whether privileged elites should
dominate mass communication and use this power to impose illusions. The question in
brief is whether democracy and freedom are values to be preserved or threats to be
avoided. 

Clearly though, there is some necessary work in society. The work required to maintain 
the standard of living that we want, but to what extent does it need to be onerous and 
undesirable? There is a good deal of pride in work well done, especially if it includes 
management of the enterprise. Suppose though, that there is some residue of work that 
no one wants to do, then that residue of work must be shared.

As an example, take a look at Trump voters. People in manufacturing towns like Arkansas. 
They're people who work in coal mines, blue collar workers. This is not fun, but they 
don't want a government handout. They don't want to sit on a couch, they want their jobs.
Jobs which they've lost because the US doesn't manufacture anymore. Along the same vein 
there's a lot of writing from the working class press, a lot of whome were women working
in farms and factories that ran their own newspapers. All they wanted was dignity, they
renounced the industrial system for destroying their rights as independent people. They 
attacked the motto of gain wealth for getting all but self. 
```
If you sell something you created, like an artisan, you're not selling yourself, if you 
sell labor you are. 
```

Human intelligence hasn't been devoted to design work in a way that can fit the producer. 
Today, we try to figure out how the human being could be fitted into a larger system that 
works for profit, instead we could figure out how to use science and technology to make work
more pleasing for humans. Let's assume 3 kinds of society:    

1. Undesired work given to wage slaves under duress, under threat of starvation
2. Undersired work, after the application of science, tech and intelligence, is shared.
3. Undesired work is most highly paid.

A good part of human history, people did get a substantial part of satisfaction from what 
they do. This was enhanced by industrialization because machines removed the drudgery. There
is a notion that contributing to pleasure is inversely correlated to value of that work, which
is debateable. Most of the occupation that exists have an intrinsic satisfaction that involves
interaction with the humans involved. 

Human beings are a tool of production. Industrial psychology study that work cannot be well 
done because of the short turn around cycles. Studies on longevity, including cigarettes and
alcohol, the #1 thing that contributes is job satisfaction. The feeling that what you're doing
is important is a very significant factor in your own happiness. 

Now of course employment is essential for the economy, in fact forcing "vagrants" to go to work 
might push inflation down. As soon as one begins to look at these issues there are several other 
issues to be raised. What about forcing welfare mothers to work? What is work? This is supposed 
to be a meritocratic society and we're very proud of it. So if you get paid more in a 
meritocracy, you're doing something worth doing. If you're going to wall street and speculating 
against currencies in an effort to drive down growth rates, whereas someone raising a child 
needs to be driven to work because they're doing none. 

Every economist agrees that if you want to be serious, you can't talk about humans like creatures
with rights, you have to talk about them as capital. Human capital is how much a human being can
contribute to growth. As long as they're strong enough to get out of bed and eat they're capital. 
Ironically, with this view of the world, mothers are increasing human capital, so they need to get 
paid a lot more than welfare. The natural rate of unemployment is this mystic number, when 
employment hits it, inflation goes up. There's another reason to pay people to keep them off the 
labor market. The whole thing is such a tissue of internal contradictions. If you're speculating 
against currencies and running a mint you are driving down growth rates, so it shouldn't even be 
viewed as work, it's a crime. 
```
We shouldn't get trapped into entering a dicussion on the premesis on which it's being pursued. 
```

## Wage ~slavery~ labor

Lets take a really harsh institution that we don't argue about: slavery. The plantation 
economy. Masters treated the slaves very nicely, allowed to live their family lives, 
never got beat up etc. The trouble was the institution, the idea that a person can be 
owned is just an intolerable infringement of human rights. Same about people who are 
rented, regardless of whether the guy who rents you is nice to you. The question is 
whether decisions about production, investment, what goes on on the shop floor, harassment
etc should be upto public thought? 

If you go back to the origin of democratic thought, you will see in the `knights of labor` 
public statement, that wage labour is not all that different from slavery. `Humboldt`, who
was the inspiration of `John Steward Mill`, the leading principle of his thought, is that 
human beings are born to *inquire and create*, and to do so under their own initiative. 

```
If a person does beautiful work, under external command [i.e for wages], we may admire
what he does but we will despire what he is. 
```
Any work a person does under outside order is inhuman. The art might advance, but the 
artisan declines. That's classical liberal thought.

They don't tell you that in Chicago school (anymore than they tell you what `Adam Smith`
really said), but that school of thought was driven by concepts of human rights and 
dignities, and it is seriously infringed by the structure of business organizations. You 
can't be a nice guy in certain situations because the institutions are not nice. The 
profit of organizations sholdn't lead us to overlook what's wrong with the authoritarian 
structure required to run business.

Of course this is cheap for me to say because I'm in a fancy university. The degree of 
workers control at the elite level is so privileged; forget the money, if they paid you 
a tenth of it it would still be a much better existence than working on command. I think
people _know_ that. While we can't have every individual controlling every single thing,
we can setup democratic structures. 

## Democracy in the workplace

Business is a tyranny. If you're in the middle you take orders from the top, if you're at
the bottom you're renting yourself out. There's no reason this needs to be the case, the 
workers can have a say in the organization, so can the community. The question we have to 
ask ourselves is, is that an alternative and do we want to work for it? If it is, it would
dismantle capitalizm. We just need to decide if it's what the workers in the plant want. 

My guess is that most people are ready for it this minute, if the opportunity arises 
they'd leap at it this minute. It's just that the options aren't there. They'll take the 
risk but the consequences need community support. The workers in the plant need to take 
a serious risk. The police will come in and beat the shit out of them, unless they have 
community support they're not going to get away with it. Workers will understand this 
problem just like the factory girls in Lowell in 1860, it's class struggle. 

1977 US steel decided to close one of its major facilities in Youngstown, Ohio. Instead 
of just walking away the community turned it into a worked owned worker managed facility. 
While they didn't win, it was partial. Even though they lost it set off other efforts 
that has led to a scattering of 100s of sometimes not so small partially worker owned
industries. That's the basis of a real revolution.

One of the problems initiating such a revolution is that while a sitdown protest, or a 
general strikes valid tactics, we can only think of them as possibilities at a time when
the population is ready for it. Marx said the task is not just to understand the world 
but to change it. The corollary is if you want to change the world in a constructive 
direction, you need to understand it first. This doesn't mean listening to a talk or 
reading a book, although this helps sometimes, it means learning. This usually means long 
hard dedicated work. 

The thing that makes this hard are some tyrannical structures called corporations. They 
internalize risk, free participants from market discipline and have a million ways to 
influence government. They are the _media_, and the _entertainent_ industry, and 
advertisement. They don't like the government because the government have a defect. It's 
partially influencible by the public, whereas GE is not influencable at all. In particular 
they hate the federal government.  

That's the point of pushing things down to the state level. Any welfare system for example. 
National level, maybe just Microsoft can push them around through the Gates foundation, but 
at the state level, even middle size businesses can push for regressive fiscal measures and 
a shift in the tax code, which means money goes back to them. This is the core of the 
"corruption":    

* More decision making into private un-accountable power
* Reduce the federal government, except the parts that work for corporations (eg: pentagon)
* Push as much down to the state level as possible

That's what we need to dismantle. It has the same intellectual roots as fascism and harsher 
forms of Bolshevism, the real question's tyranny. 

## Appendix

### The Knights of Labor

A labor union organized in 1869, they came up with a list of demands but they were 
concerned to a larger issue: what's happening to this republic. They wanted good
working conditions, equal rights, reduced racism etc. One of the first democratic
movements, the knights refused to buy anything not vetted by its union. It won
workers the 8 hour workday. 

### Lowell Mill Girls

Industrialization gave young Mill girls money to do household things. They were so
proud of their work, and of the gender reversal in the workplace, but they didn't 
realize that 12h shifts are bad. Reading books were against the rules. Finally they
join a labor union and protest wage cuts. 

Coincidentally the birth of the modern day computer began in these mills, because 
something like punch cards were required to change the colors in the mill. It's 
basic binary coding.

### Mondragon cooperative

It's a big collection of industrial works, schools, social systems. It's one of the few
parts of the Spanish economy that's competitive globally even after joining the EU. It's 
worker owned, but manager controlled. Workers pick the managers, and they theoretically
control the managers. How much is debateable, but there's not outside investors doing it. 
The workers are still picking, so that's a piece of a democratic society. 

### Trump and manufacturing

Trump came with promises to a certain sub-society in America, the people who'd lost jobs.
Those who lost jobs to engineers like me, as well so those who lost jobs to manufacturing
and service outsourcing to China and India. Trump has remained true to his promises, or at 
least he's doing a few dramatic things to make it look like he's delivering on them. However 
the big deficit is with China and this is a problem. China doesn't have a mature political 
system, there are things you can do when you have underemployed peasents and you can grow at 
9% a year but you need to evolve. So all Trump's been able to pull off till now has been a 
steel tariff. 

There's a lot of money invested, everywhere, based on an open world economy. Everytime 
it looks like we're teetering toward a tradewar stocks flop all over the place. There
would be a lot of bad debt if countries that borrowed money based on the world as it is
saw it disrupted, so Trump knows he needs to be careful. He doesn't for example want to
run the US electronics industry without inflow from China.
