## Work

There is some necessary work in society, the work required to maintain the standard of 
living that we want, but to what extent does it need to be onerous and undesirable? 
There is a good deal of pride in work well done, especially if it includes management
of the enterprise. Suppose though, that there is some residue of work that no one wants 
to do, then that residue of work must be shared. 

Human intelligence hasn't been devoted to design work in a way that can fit the producer. 
Today, we try to figure out how the human being could be fitted into a larger system that 
works for profit, instead we could figure out how to use science and technology to make work
more pleasing for humans. Let's assume 3 kinds of society:    

1. Undesired work given to wage slaves under duress, under threat of starvation
2. Undersired work, after the application of science, tech and intelligence, is shared.
3. Undesired work is most highly paid.

A good part of human history, people did get a substantial part of satisfaction from what 
they do. This was enhanced by industrialization because machines removed the drudgery. There
is a notion that contributing to pleasure is inversely correlated to value of that work, which
is debateable. Most of the occupation that exists have an intrinsic satisfaction that involves
interaction with the humans involved. 

Human beings are a tool of production. Industrial psychology study that work cannot be well 
done because of the short turn around cycles. Studies on longevity, including cigarettes and
alcohol, the #1 thing that contributes is job satisfaction. The feeling that what you're doing
is important is a very significant factor in your own happiness. 

## Wage ~slavery~ labor

Lets take a really harsh institution that we don't argue about: slavery. The plantation 
economy. Masters treated the slaves very nicely, allowed to live their family lives, 
never got beat up etc. The trouble was the institution, the idea that a person can be 
owned is just an intolerable infringement of human rights. Same about people who are 
rented, regardless of whether the guy who rents you is nice to you. The question is 
whether decisions about production, investment, what goes on on the shop floor, harassment
etc should be upto public thought? 

If you go back to the origin of democratic thought, you will see in the `knights of labor` 
public statement, that wage labour is not all that different from slavery. `Humboldt`, who
was the inspiration of `John Steward Mill`, the leading principle of his thought, is that 
human beings are born to *inquire and create*, and to do so under their own initiative. 

```
If a person does beautiful work, under external command [i.e for wages], we may admire
what he does but we will despire what he is. 
```
Any work a person does under outside order is inhuman. The art might advance, but the 
artisan declines. That's classical liberal thought.

They don't tell you that in Chicago school (anymore than they tell you what `Adam Smith`
really said), but that school of thought was driven by concepts of human rights and 
dignities, and it is seriously infringed by the structure of business organizations. You 
can't be a nice guy in certain situations because the institutions are not nice. The 
profit of organizations sholdn't lead us to overlook what's wrong with the authoritarian 
structure required to run business.

Of course this is cheap for me to say because I'm in a fancy university. The degree of 
workers control at the elite level is so privileged; forget the money, if they paid you 
a tenth of it it would still be a much better existence than working on command. I think
people _know_ that. While we can't have every individual controlling every single thing,
we can setup democratic structures. 

### Democracy in the workplace

Business is a tyranny. If you're in the middle you take orders from the top, if you're at
the bottom you're renting yourself out. There's no reason this needs to be the case, the 
workers can have a say in the organization, so can the community. The question we have to 
ask ourselves is, is that an alternative and do we want to work for it? If it is, it would
dismantle capitalizm. We just need to decide if it's what the workers in the plant want. 

My guess is that most people are ready for it this minute, if the opportunity arises 
they'd leap at it this minute. It's just that the options aren't there. They'll take the 
risk but the consequences need community support. The workers in the plant need to take 
a serious risk. The police will come in and beat the shit out of them, unless they have 
community support they're not going to get away with it. Workers will understand this 
problem just like the factory girls in Lowell in 1860, it's class struggle. 

1977 US steel decided to close one of its major facilities in Youngstown, Ohio. Instead 
of just walking away the community turned it into a worked owned worker managed facility. 
While they didn't win, it was partial. Even though they lost it set off other efforts 
that has led to a scattering of 100s of sometimes not so small partially worker owned
industries. That's the basis of a real revolution.

One of the problems initiating such a revolution is that while a sitdown protest, or a 
general strikes valid tactics, we can only think of them as possibilities at a time when
the population is ready for it. Marx said the task is not just to understand the world 
but to change it. The corollary is if you want to change the world in a constructive 
direction, you need to understand it first. This doesn't mean listening to a talk or 
reading a book, although this helps sometimes, it means learning. This usually means long 
hard dedicated work. 

## Appendix

### The Knights of Labor

A labor union organized in 1869, they came up with a list of demands but they were 
concerned to a larger issue: what's happening to this republic. They wanted good
working conditions, equal rights, reduced racism etc. One of the first democratic
movements, the knights refused to buy anything not vetted by its union. It won
workers the 8 hour workday. 

### Lowell Mill Girls

Industrialization gave young Mill girls money to do household things. They were so
proud of their work, and of the gender reversal in the workplace, but they didn't 
realize that 12h shifts are bad. Reading books were against the rules. Finally they
join a labor union and protest wage cuts. 

Coincidentally the birth of the modern day computer began in these mills, because 
something like punch cards were required to change the colors in the mill. It's 
basic binary coding.

### Mondragon cooperative

It's a big collection of industrial works, schools, social systems. It's one of the few
parts of the Spanish economy that's competitive globally even after joining the EU. It's 
worker owned, but manager controlled. Workers pick the managers, and they theoretically
control the managers. How much is debateable, but there's not outside investors doing it. 
The workers are still picking, so that's a piece of a democratic society.
