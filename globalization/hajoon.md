# Globalization

The world is richer than ever because of globalization. This is 
trivially true. The question is can growth be even better. Can't 
keep repeating policies of 1960 and everything will be fine. 

## Growth

* Living through it you don't quite realize the significance of it. 
* At the same time there were a lot of conflicts
* Korea attained the miracle rate of growth till the (86)
* Deindustrialization of the industrial north

## Neoliberalism x globalization

* Globalization has been going on for 500 years
  - Colonization, Genocide
  - Dutch right movement(?)
  - Spike in the eighties so it's linked to Neoliberalism
* NeoLiberalism became popular in the eighties 
  - Liberals are people who want an open economy
  - The 19th century liberals were against central banks
  - England refused to protect patents in 1912
  - Neos accepted CBs, IPs, floating exchange rates etc
* Economies were driven by selfish rational individuals etc
* Neoliberalism: Applies the rational of markets to the our 
  social part of our lives

```console
Some countries allow more areas of life to be affected by market
principles, and some sectors might have more market pressure.
``` 
[ US - Finland spectrum ]

* Corporate work-ethic ethos drives neo liberalism
* Poor people work harder - England lost to Germans 
  - Greeks work 40% longer in spite of being in Fin trouble
  - Mexicans work 25% more
* Corporate is permeating in an increasing number of areas

## Central ideas

* Infant industry argument: economic rationale for nascent industry
  protection
  - Backward countries need to protect and nurture their industry: 
    Americans - british, south korea - japan, Britan - Netherlands)
* Cars
  - Brazil: Invite Fiat, Renault etc
  - Korea: Drive shitty cars till they can export cars
    a. Import of foreign cars were banned
  - India: We can't build nice cars, but we don't want them
    a. They're an imperialist conspiracy
    b. Kept reproducing old skool 1950 British cars

## Other economists

* Ace Argues that countries should remain open to tech/innovation
  - Countries that haven't end up horribly
* Piketty argues that protectionism increases inequality
  - The protected companies end up with rich CEOs
  - Elephant graph

```console
Globalization benefits:
* The rising middle class in the dev country
* The 1% all over the world
```

* Ha-Joon argues that we need to drive around shit cars
* How should they protect the industry while still being open?
  - Industries need to figure out how to use the technologies
  - They must import the tech but make them their own
  - Primary school students just absorb and memorize
  - Countries can't refuse to absorb, but can't repeat

## IMF, World Bank, WTO: Institutions of globalization 

* A lot of developing countries have their own elite 
  - They don't want protectionism
  - Hamilton vs Jefferson, north vs south 
  - North wanted protection, south landlords didn't
  - Why not just import from Europe, it's better after all
* Dev eco policy makers know that open markets are bad 
  - Wall Street fund can eat them for lunch

```console
Countries have reacted differently to international pressure
  - Colobia: Money comes in fine, but if you can't leave 
    a. Penalty: need to drop 30% 
    b. Deposit system, discourages short term fin flows 
    c. Short term financial flows are destabilizing
    d. It creates speculative financial environment 
```

* 80/90s the only way to get foreigh exchange was from WB
* The IMF and WB have changed a bit
* In 03 IMFs main goal: open capital markets everywhere
  - Since 05 they've stated that OPM is bad for dev 
* Same recipie, different country, Washington consensus
  - IMF economist for Bolivian president
  - Forgot to change name from Colobia -> Bolivia
* Previously there was only 1 bank in town: World Bank
  - Alternative financial institutions 
  - Asian infrastructure bank, Bankodosol in Latin America

## Appendix 

* Dutch right movement
* How to select ind. of strategic importance for protection?
  - For a developing country this is not so relevant
  - Rich countries: Steel, Automobiles, Petrochems, Elecs
  - Protect these from foreign entry
* Wait for a technology paradim shift 
  - Dev economies can climb the ladder quickly
  - Solar, battery, IOT
  - Countries become good at something because they decided
  - Japs said they want to be good at making cars
