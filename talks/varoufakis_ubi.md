    - Min wages negotiated with unions

* Can India leapfrog the social democratic market?
* Dying because of 2 shocks
  a. Financialization
    - massive transfer of wealth to financial sector
    - bankruptocracy 
    - creates deflationary forces
  b. Rise of the machines
    - AI will consume repetative machine work
    - The moment machines pass the turing test
    - Speak to someone on the phone 
    - Massive displacement effect - more destruction of jobs
    - Machines can replace humans in the service sector 
    - Every tech innovation displaces and creates 
    - This will will displace more, and create worse jobs

* Wealth is privately produced and collectively appropriated
  - It's actually collectively produced
  - Corporations are producing value
* Illusory separation between the markets and the state

## Basic income

This is really about giving money to the undeserving. We 
should talk about underving people getting money because 
they're part of a wealth producing society. 

* Do the rich need basic income? 
  - It's better to target the money on deserving few
  - To do this we need a beaucracy
  - Beaucrats love to reproduce
  - Similar to psychiatry - power structure 
  - Michelle Focoult
* People have a right to a job not to income
  - BI promotes sloth
  - We should really censure those who are idle not starve
  - The right to turn down a job is essential 
  - To turn down a job we need an outside option
  - Desperate people do desperate things
* BI is a foundation to stand on, not a safety net
  - If caught by the net it's hard to untangle
* Liberty is defined in a negative sense sometimes 
  - Hayek, lack of constraints: Mafia
  - Each side must have a capacity to say no
* Allows creative work to replace algorithmic work
  - This is already being displaced by AI
* Rich people have a right to a trust fund
  - BI is a trust fund to everyone
  - Financed by everyone because capital is collective

## Appendix

  - Renaissance things were better for the mad
  - In the mid-17th century we medicalized them
  - They were locked up in clinics
  - The medical doctor is a sinister figure

  - They had a sense of being institutionally important
  - Till we got turnover from contractors
  - Contractors were paid less and turnt over repeatedly
  - Hire by night, not connected to the place, rotated
* Humans minds live in terror of bankruptcy
