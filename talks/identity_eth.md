# Identity

Welfare, governance, voting

* Identity is realitively simple, do we need Aadhar for it? 
* Identity is social - humans rely a lot on the face
* Password/private key is stealable
  - hash(photo is the private key)
  - put a million photos online, angles etc
* Ask a web of trust to basically invalidate that identity(?)
* How do you establish, without your private key, that you're you?
* Bank grade security - mothers maiden name is backed by government
  - First world backs the ability to do shitty security
  - The police threat allows for bad security
* What if you can make an identity that can't be stolen?
