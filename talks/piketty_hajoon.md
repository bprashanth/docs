# Developing markets

Rich countries use government subsidies and regulations to 
promote capitalism. US had the highest tariff in the world
in the 19th century, so why are they dictating free trade
free market policies?

* Negotiaions via the WTO push these policies
* Japan, Korea, Taiwan succeeded, Latin America failed 
  - 60s Korean was open to exports not to imports
* Initially a country has to protect their own enterprises

## Does this create a labour oligarchy? 

* Companies that are protected, their CEOs get paid highly.
* Protectionism (not enough) + Education expansion + Countries 
  need to build up:
  - industrial strength
  - specializatoin in world economy. 
* The above policy is lacking today in underdeveloped countries
  partly because of the theoretical discourse being imposed on 
  them (liberalizatoin). 
  - Results in losses in tax revenue not compensated by 
    an increase in their fiscal capacity/ability to make 
    other taxes replace the old revenue.
  - Loss of this tax leads to reduced investment in public

## Which countries succeed? 

When can a country use protectionism?

* Perfect competition didn't get the US and Britan to where 
  they are, US had a lot of protection in early 20th century.
  - But no one is advocating perfect competition/free markets
  - What we need is a combination of government and markets
  - The trick is how much of which 
  - Not complete state intervention
* 1950 Brazil and Japan sucked at cars
  - Fiat and Renault invited to Brazil, they didn't come 
    without tariff protections
  - Japan just rode around in shit cars and gave companies
    protection contingent on improved productivity

### What does a country need?

1. Right kind of elits are important
  - The elites should want to develop the country
  - Are they only interested in buying houses in Miami?
  - Korean elites needed a lot of prodding, things are not 
    different because of culture
2. Strategy to integrate into the global economy
  - Can't just build a wall and live inside it
3. Invest in raising productivity
  - R&D, infra, education lead to an expansion of productivity
    these are funded by the tariffs
  - R&D subsidized, labour training
4. Fiscal and democratic institutions 
  - people are not reasonable
  - Free speech includes the rights of billionaires to buy as 
    much political space as they can?

### What kind of institutions?

Everyone accepts we need stronger institutions. Countries where 
the rule of law is weak and public sectory is dysfunctional, 
how do they build institutions? Economists have talked a lot 
about institutions but very little about the technology around
institution building. 

* Resource and man power to implement the institution laws?
* Developing countries unhappy with US patent laws from WTO
* Use cultural aspects of society to build new institutions?
* Which are the most important institutions?
  - Ministry of education
  - Electoral council (entity that makes sure elections are free)
  - Health department
* Cannot reproduce the same elite social structure with corrupt
  electoral practice. Depends on country.
* Institutions are built through political mobilization


## Appendix

Trade deficits and surplus reflects nations doing things in their 
own best interests.

## International Trade 

* Net exports = export - imports
  - US imports and exports the most from Canada
  - IP goods: Pixar movies and Kanye albums
* Trade deficit/surplus = net exports <> 0
  - This is also called current account deficit
  - Trade deficits could result in unemployment because we're importing
* US buys clothes from other countries and focues on things it's good at
  - Other countries have a comparitive advantage
  - There are side-effects like bad working conditions and env
* Free trade usually lowers prices of consumer goods but hurts labour
* Protectionism: high tariffs and trade barriers
* WTO designed to eradicate protectionism, settles disputes
  - Favours rich countries
* Trade between countries:
  - Demand, political stability, interest rates, exchange rate
* When the dollar appreciates US imports rise and exports fall 
  - Floating exchange rates means more Pesos leave Mexico
  - The Peso appreciates and the Dollar depreciates 
  - Some countries peg
  - China's central bank keeps the exchange rate constant
  - They just "buy" USD for Yuans, keeping exports to the US cheap

### Balance of Payments 

* Accounting statement maintained at national level
* Made up of current and financial account
  - Current: foreign aid, goods and services sale/purchase
  - Financial (capital account): financial assets sale/purchase
* What can China do with USD? 
  - Buy US goods 
  - Buy financial assets like stocks and bonds
* If a country wants to import but can't export, they need to sell 
* The assets sold are recorded in the financial account
* Countries with a negative deficit have a higher amount of FDI

### Tariffs

* Domestic policies and protectionary measures result in government gains
  - Bangladesh, China, Vietnam 
* Tariffs are basically taxes on imported goods
* If Vietnam shirts are allowed in US the prices drop; so they're taxed
* US consumer surplus is still high, it's not at market equilibrium
  - The US is currently in deficit (they import a lot more than they export)
  - Usually deficits put a downward pressure on a country's currency
  - USD is the reserve currency so the US can survive with large deficits
